  first_line: Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away
  body: "Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,<br>\r\nthink, to liberty: yet am
    I better<br>\r\nThan one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather<br>\r\nGroan
    so in perpetuity than be cured<br>\r\nBy the sure physician, death, who is the
    key<br>\r\nTo unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd <br>\r\nMore
    than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me<br>\r\nThe penitent instrument
    to pick that bolt,<br>\r\nThen, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?<br>\r\nSo
    children temporal fathers do appease;<br>\r\nGods are more full of mercy. Must
    I repent? <br>\r\nI cannot do it better than in gyves,<br>\r\nDesired more than
    constrain'd: to satisfy,<br>\r\nIf of my freedom 'tis the main part, take<br>\r\nNo
    stricter render of me than my all.<br>\r\nI know you are more clement than vile
    men,<br>\r\nWho of their broken debtors take a third,<br>\r\nA sixth, a tenth,
    letting them thrive again<br>\r\nOn their abatement: that's not my desire:<br>\r\nFor
    Imogen's dear life take mine; and though<br>\r\n'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life;
    you coin'd it:<br>\r\n'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;<br>\r\nThough
    light, take pieces for the figure's sake:<br>\r\nYou rather mine, being yours:
    and so, great powers,<br>\r\nIf you will take this audit, take this life,<br>\r\nAnd
    cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen! <br>\r\nI'll speak to thee in silence. <br>\r\n"

  first_line: No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,
  body: "No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,<br>\r\n      But that the heavens
    fought: the king himself<br>\r\n      Of his wings destitute, the army broken,<br>\r\n
    \     And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying<br>\r\n      Through a straight
    lane; the enemy full-hearted, <br>\r\n      Lolling the tongue with slaughtering,
    having work<br>\r\n      More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down<br>\r\n
    \     Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling<br>\r\n      Merely through
    fear; that the straight pass was damm'd<br>\r\n      With dead men hurt behind,
    and cowards living <br>\r\n      To die with lengthen'd shame. <br>\r\n<p>\r\n
    \   <del> Lord. Where was this lane? </del>\r\n<p>\r\nClose by the battle, ditch'd,
    and wall'd with turf;<br>\r\n      Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,<br>\r\n
    \     An honest one, I warrant; who deserved <br>\r\n      So long a breeding
    as his white beard came to,<br>\r\n      In doing this for's country: athwart
    the lane,<br>\r\n      He, with two striplings-lads more like to run<br>\r\n      The
    country base than to commit such slaughter<br>\r\n      With faces fit for masks,
    or rather fairer <br>\r\n      Than those for preservation cased, or shame.<br>\r\n
    \     Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,<br>\r\n      'Our Britain
    s harts die flying, not our men:<br>\r\n      To darkness fleet souls that fly
    backwards. Stand;<br>\r\n      Or we are Romans and will give you that <br>\r\n
    \     Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,<br>\r\n      But to look
    back in frown: stand, stand.'\r\n      These three,<br>\r\n      Three thousand
    confident, in act as many.<br>\r\n      For three performers are the file when
    all <br>\r\n      The rest do nothing.with this word 'Stand, stand,'<br>\r\n      Accommodated
    by the place, more charming<br>\r\n      With their own nobleness, which could
    have turn'd<br>\r\n      A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,<br>\r\n      Part
    shame, part spirit renew'd; that some, \r\n      turn'd coward<br>\r\n      But

    look<br>\r\n      The way that they did, and to grin like lions<br>\r\n      Upon
    the pikes o' the hunters. Then began <br>\r\n      A stop i' the chaser, a retire,
    anon<br>\r\n      A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly<br>\r\n      Chickens,
    the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,<br>\r\n      The strides they victors
    made: and now our cowards,<br>\r\n      Like fragments in hard voyages, became
    <br>\r\n      The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open<br>\r\n      Of
    the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!<br>\r\n      Some slain before;
    some dying; some their friends<br>\r\n      O'er borne i' the former wave: ten,
    chased by one,<br>\r\n      Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty: <br>\r\n
    \     Those that would die or ere resist are grown<br>\r\n      The mortal bugs
    o' the field. <br>\r\n<p>\r\n   <del> Lord. This was strange chance\r\n      A
    narrow lane, an old man, and two boys. </del>\r\n<p>\r\nNay, do not wonder at
    it: you are made <br>\r\n      Rather to wonder at the things you hear<br>\r\n
    \     Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,<br>\r\n      And vent it for a
    mockery? Here is one:<br>\r\n      'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,<br>\r\n
    \     Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.' <br>\r\n<p>\r\n   <del> Lord.
    Nay, be not angry, sir. </del>\r\n<p>\r\n'Lack, to what end?<br>\r\n      Who
    dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;<br>\r\n      For if he'll do as he
    is made to do,<br>\r\n      I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too. <br>\r\n

  first_line: O, no! wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown
  body: " O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown: <br>\r\nThe circumstance I'll
    tell you more at large. <br>\r\nThe tenth of August last this dreadful lord, <br>\r\nRetiring
    from the siege of Orleans, <br>\r\nHaving full scarce six thousand in his troop.
    <br>\r\nBy three and twenty thousand of the French <br>\r\nWas round encompassed
    and set upon. <br>\r\nNo leisure had he to enrank his men; <br>\r\nHe wanted pikes
    to set before his archers; <br>\r\nInstead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of
    hedges <br>\r\nThey pitched in the ground confusedly, <br>\r\nTo keep the horsemen
    off from breaking in. <br>\r\nMore than three hours the fight continued; <br>\r\nWhere
    valiant Talbot above human thought <br>\r\nEnacted wonders with his sword and
    lance: <br>\r\nHundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him; <br>\r\nHere,
    there, and every where, enraged he flew: <br>\r\nThe French exclaim'd, the devil
    was in arms; <br>\r\nAll the whole army stood agazed on him: <br>\r\nHis soldiers
    spying his undaunted spirit <br>\r\nA Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain <br>\r\nAnd
    rush'd into the bowels of the battle. <br>\r\nHere had the conquest fully been
    seal'd up, <br>\r\nIf Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward: <br>\r\nHe,
    being in the vaward, placed behind <br>\r\nWith purpose to relieve and follow
    them, <br>\r\nCowardly fled, not having struck one stroke. <br>\r\nHence grew
    the general wreck and massacre; <br>\r\nEnclosed were they with their enemies:
    <br>\r\nA base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace, <br>\r\nThrust Talbot with
    a spear into the back,<br>\r\nWhom all France with their chief assembled strength
    <br>\r\nDurst not presume to look once in the face."

  first_line: We'll set thee to school to an ant
  body: "We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's no \r\nlabouring
    i' th' winter. All that follow their noses are led by\r\ntheir eyes but blind
    men, and there's not a nose among twenty\r\nbut can smell him that's stinking.
    Let go thy hold when a great\r\nwheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck
    with following\r\nit; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee after.\r\nWhen
    a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again. I\r\nwould have none
    but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.<br>\r\nThat sir which serves and
    seeks for gain,<br>\r\nAnd follows but for form,<br>\r\nWill pack when it begins
    to rain <br>\r\nAnd leave thee in the storm.<br>\r\nBut I will tarry; the fool
    will stay,<br>\r\nAnd let the wise man fly.<br>\r\nThe knave turns fool that runs
    away;<br>\r\nThe fool no knave, perdy. "

  first_line: To be thus is nothing;
  body: |
    To be thus is nothing;<br>
    But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo<br>
    Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature<br>
    Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;<br>
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,<br>
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour<br>
    To act in safety. There is none but he<br>
    Whose being I do fear: and, under him,<br>
    My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said, <br>
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters<br>
    When first they put the name of king upon me,<br>
    And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like<br>
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings:<br>
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,<br>
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,<br>
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,<br>
    No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,<br>
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;<br>
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;<br>
    Put rancours in the vessel of my peace<br>
    Only for them; and mine eternal jewel<br>
    Given to the common enemy of man,<br>
    To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!<br>
    Rather than so, come fate into the list. <br>
    And champion me to the utterance!
